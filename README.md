# CompiAgent
Ontology first Artificial Intelligence Agent

This repository includes a reference implementation written in Godot (WIP)

Here you can find information about the motivation behind the project ([Medium article](https://medium.com/eibriel/open-virtual-beings-for-the-open-metaverse-e35f7c0c0fc)).

## What is CompiAgent
CompiAgent is a file standard to store, run and share intelligent virtual beings that can run locally.

Includes:
- A conversational user interface using a simplified natural language (in progress)
- An ontology engine to store a simplified model of the concepts that can be found in the world (in progress)
- A fact engine database to store static knowledge about the world (not started)
- A short term / long term memory to store knowledge about the environment (not started)
- A lexicon engine to store mappings between concepts and natural language (not started)

Databases:
- Ontology (concepts)
- Facts (concept instances)
- Lexicon (lexemes)
- Onomasticon (names)
